When classic light toggles are to easy to operate...

In every single part of our Hackerspace, the switch is on the opposite side of the room. You had to wander in the darkness through The Stacks Of Useful Components lying around, fighting for life with inhabitants of our coffee mugs.
Up to now. It’s over. Finally, we did it. Half of our Hackerspace has now remote-controlled lights.
We’re using Arduino with Ethernet Shield, relay modules (some of them handcrafted), duct tape and a lot of Magic Smoke.
The TwitterClient example was wonderful starting point for our project. Mostly because API 1.0 used in example is deprecated now, so we weren’t able to easily use Twitter API. Instead, we used Twitter Bootstrap :-)
